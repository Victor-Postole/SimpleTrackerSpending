# SimpleTrackerSpending

Simple tracker spending with API integration by using Android Composable and Kotlin Coroutines.
Methodology I have used is Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Desgin for RoomDatabase and API integration. 
Application is running Koin for dependency injection and Retrofit for API calls(it can be improved by replacing the Retrofit extantions with Ktor)
Design patterns MVI and MVVM for UI organization.
